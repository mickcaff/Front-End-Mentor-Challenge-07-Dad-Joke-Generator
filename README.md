# Frontend Mentor - Joke generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). I switched the advice API for a dad jokes API, just to make it a bit more fun. Link to the API is below in the Useful Resources section.

This was the first Front-End Mentor challenge that I implemented with JavaScript.
My major learnings with this challenge were about:
- Fetch API
- Async & Await (Promises)
- Adding Event Listeners


### Continued development

- I'll continue to learn about connecting to third-party APIs.
- I'm currently learning about implementing drag and drop features with DOM manipulation
- In the next few weeks I'll start to learn React.
